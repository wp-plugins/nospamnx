To protect your Blog from automated spambots, which fill you comments with junk, this plugin adds additional formfields (hidden to human-users) to your comment form. These Fields are checked every time a new comment is posted. 

== Description ==

Most Antispam Plugins focus on user interaction, e.g. captcha or Math calculations to defend you against automated comment spambots. Some use JavaScript and/or Sessions, check each comment against common spam phrases or modify your comment template. NoSpamNX intend to handle automated comment-spam without these measures. It does not require JavaScript, Cookies or Sessions. It does not change any of your comment template fields, given you full compatibility with other WordPress- or Browser Plugins.

NoSpamNX automaticly adds additional formfields to your comment form, invisible to human users. If a spambot fills these fields blindly (which 99.9% of all spambots do), the comment will not be saved. You can decide if you want to block these spambots or mark them as spam. Furthermore, you can put common spam-phrases on a blacklist.
	
The user must no longer fill out any additional fields in the comment form, and you can focus on blogging and your readers comments!


= Requirements =

Make sure your theme loads <code>wp_head</code> and <code>comment_form</code> according to the WordPress Codex (see http://is.gd/1lezf), otherwise NoSpamNX will not work properly!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After i update to Version x.x the plugin seems broken! =

In 99.9% this is becaus NoSpamNX misses some options. Deactivate and (re)activate the plugin.

= When i activate the plugin, the hidden fields are visible! =

Make sure that the template you are using calls <code>wp_head</code> before the closing HEAD tag. See http://is.gd/tazh for more information.

= My template does load <code>wp_head</code>, but the hidden fields are still visible! =

First, deactivate and re-active the Plugin. Then go to settings -> NoSpamNX and reset the CSS Name.

= What is the difference to other anti-comment-spam plugins? =

Spambots are stopped within the plugin. You don't see them and most important you don't have to moderate them!

= Does the plugin block Ping-/Trackback Spam as well? =

No, the plugin focus on automated spambots only.

= What about false-positives? =

Due to the functionality of NoSpamNX false-positives are nearly impossible. There 'might' be problems when using WordPress Cache-Plugins, but none have ever been reported. If you are uncertain, mark Spambots as Spam instead of blocking them.
