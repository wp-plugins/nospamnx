To protect your Blog from automated spambots, which fill you comments with junk, this plugin adds additional formfields (hidden to human-users) to your comment form. These Fields are checked every time a new comment is posted. 

== Description ==

There have been many new good ideas of fighting automated Spam in WordPress. Most of these Plugins (like the antecessor of NoSpamNX: Yawasp) change the name of one (or more) of your comment field. On the one hand, this is indeed more effective, but on the other hand, this goes to the expense of compatibility. Therefore, NoSpamNX does not change any of your comment fields, but still claims to be very effective. 

Many Antispam Plugins focus on user interaction, e.g. captcha or Math calculations to defend you against automated comment spambots. Some use JavaScript and/or Sessions, check each comment against common spam phrases or modify your comment template. NoSpamNX intend to handle automated comment-spam without these measures. It does not require JavaScript, Cookies, Sessions or a Database. It does not change any of your comment template fields, given you full compatibility with other WordPress- or Browser Plugins.

NoSpamNX automaticly adds additional formfields to your comment form, invisible to human users. If a spambot fills these fields blindly (which 99.9% of all spambots do), the comment will not be saved. You can decide if you want to block these spambots or mark them as spam. Furthermore, you can put common spam-phrases on a blacklist.
	
The user must no longer fill out any additional fields in the comment form, and you can focus on blogging and your readers comments!


= Requirements =

Make sure your theme loads <code>wp_head</code> and <code>comment_form</code> according to the WordPress Codex (see http://is.gd/1lezf), otherwise NoSpamNX will not work properly!

== Installation ==

2. Copy the nospamnx folder to your wp-content/plugins folder
3. Activate plugin
4. (Optional) Adjust settings (settings -> NoSpamNX)

Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After I updated to Version x.x the Options are reseted! =

Update at least to Version 3.14. Since this Version the Options are only reseted if new options are available.

= After I updated to Version x.x the plugin seems broken! =

In 99.9% this is because NoSpamNX misses some options. Deactivate and (re)activate the plugin.

= When I activate the plugin, the hidden fields are visible! =

Make sure that the template you are using calls <code>wp_head</code> before the closing HEAD tag. See http://is.gd/tazh for more information.

= My template does load <code>wp_head</code>, but the hidden fields are still visible! =

First, deactivate and re-active the Plugin. Then go to Settings -> NoSpamNX and reset the CSS Name.

= What is the difference to other Anti-Spambots plugins? =

Most "new" AntiSpam Plugin change the name of one (or more) of you comment field. On the one hand, this is indeed more effective, but on the other hand, this goes to the expense of compatibility. NoSpamNX does not change any of your comment field, but still is very effective. Furthermore Spambots are stopped within the plugin. You don't see them, and most important, you don't have to moderate them (if you don't want to)!

= Does the plugin block Ping-/Trackback Spam as well? =

No, the plugin focus on automated Spambots only and I have no plans of changing that. There are some really good Plugins in the WordPress Repository for that.

= What about false-positives? =

Due to the functionality of NoSpamNX false-positives are nearly impossible. There 'might' be problems when using WordPress Cache-Plugins, but none have ever been reported. If you are uncertain, mark Spambots as Spam instead of blocking them.
